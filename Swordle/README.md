Swordle is a simple client-side word guessing game built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player get a random word from between 1150~ words, and you get to guess the word. The player will get a limited number of tries depending on the game mode selected. There are three game modes, x3 where you get a word of three letters and three guesses only, x4 where you get a word of four letters and four guesses only, and x5 where you get a word of five letters and five guesses only.

The JavaScript logic of the game is designed in two styles, functional style and object-oriented style. Both styles are written in separate script files inside the scripts directory. Only one of the script files should be linked to the HTML file via the `<script>` tag.

The script files use the ES6 `import` and `export` commands, so marking the `<script>` tags with `type="module"` is necessary.

So far, the game only supports computers but not mobile devices.
